# 🚆 Train Search Platform

The **Train Search Platform** is a web-based application that allows users to search for train availability, including direct and multi-train routes. It simplifies route planning by automatically finding the best options, displaying available seats, and estimating travel time.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 **Train Search**: Find direct and multi-train routes between stations.
- 📄 **Multi-Train Route Optimization**: Automatically suggests the best possible route with multiple trains if no direct train is available.
- 🌟 **Seat Availability**: Displays available seats for each train option.
- ⏳ **Estimated Travel Time**: Provides an estimated duration for the selected route.
- 🗺 **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use UI for quick searches.
- **Optimized Performance with Indexing**  
  - Implemented database indexing to speed up query execution.  
  - Ensures faster data retrieval for frequently accessed records.  
- **Faster Data Streaming with SSE (Server-Sent Events)**  
  - Instead of waiting for the entire dataset, results are sent one by one.  
  - Improves user experience by displaying data as soon as it is available.  
  - Reduces client-side waiting time for large queries.
